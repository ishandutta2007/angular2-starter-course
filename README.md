# Get Started with Angular 2

Angular 2 is the great new framework that will provide us a great deal of flexibility and power when building our apps.

## Goals

- Build an Angular 2 app
- Create an Angular 2 starter kit: [GitHub](https://github.com/scotch-io/angular2-starter-basic) and [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/V5tKs3?p=info)
- Understand what goes into setting up Angular 2

## Setup

The environment setup is the biggest reason developers have not gotten into Angular 2. We're going to clarify the setup and talk about why it's necessary.

- Setup our base project
- Setup [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): To transpile ES6 code to ES5 and give us extra convenient features
- Setup [System.js](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs): To load packages in our browsers
